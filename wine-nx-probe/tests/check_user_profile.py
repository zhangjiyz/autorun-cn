"""The profile directory has to be the one shell32 resolves.

dlls/shell32/shellpath.c does not expand %USERPROFILE% from the environment: in
_SHExpandEnvironmentStrings it builds every CSIDL_Type_User folder as
ProfilesDirectory (C:\\users by default) plus GetUserNameW(), which this Wine
answers with the name in dlls/advapi32/advapi.c. SHGetFolderPathW then refuses a
folder that is not on the card unless the caller passed CSIDL_FLAG_CREATE, and a
game that does not test that failure builds its path from an empty string -
FalloutNV read C:\\My Games\\FalloutNV\\FalloutPrefs.ini, found nothing, and
handed itself back to its launcher.

So: the runtime's profile must be named after GetUserName, its environment must
agree with it, the per-user folders shell32 precreates must be made, and the
settings the packager stages must sit inside that profile."""
