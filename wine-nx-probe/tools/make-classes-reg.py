"""Write the COM classes the staged DLLs serve, as a registry file the runtime
reads before a program asks for one.

On Windows each DLL's DllRegisterServer writes these when it is installed, and
Wine runs them from wine.inf at first boot. Nothing here installs anything, so a
program that asked for a class got REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG and, more often than not,
used the null pointer it did not check: Fallout New Vegas creating its filter
graph, Halo its text service.

A class comes from the IDL of the DLL that serves it -- a coclass with a uuid,
which is what widl turns into those same registry keys -- and only from a DLL
whose spec exports DllGetClassObject, since one that does not cannot serve a
class whatever the registry says.

Some DLLs are one source built many times, XAudio2 2.0 to 2.7 and XACT among
them, and the IDL picks each version's class with #if, which a scan of the text
cannot follow. widl has already followed it: the registration script it builds
into the DLL, which its DllRegisterServer writes from, names the classes of that
version. Those come second, so a class the IDL gave a DLL stays with it.
