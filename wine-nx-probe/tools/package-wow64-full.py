==============================

Copy the collection onto the card -- leave __Installer and Support behind, they
are for a computer -- and run sims2-setup.exe once from the launcher. It writes
what the release's own "Instalar Registros" batch file writes, with the card's
paths, and says what it did in autorun_runtime.log as [SIMS2 SETUP] lines.
Running it again is harmless.

Where the packs go does not matter much. Each one is recognised by the
executable in its TSBin, not by the name of the folder around it, so a release
that calls them Base and EP1-EP9 and one that spells out "The Sims 2 Nightlife"
both work, and the collection may keep a folder of its own around them. Put
sims2-setup.exe's folder beside the packs, or beside the folder holding them.

The setup also copies dxvk.conf from its folder into each pack's TSBin, next to
the executable. It holds the game to 512 MB of video memory: DXVK's own profile
for The Sims 2 reports 2 GB, and on the Switch the game fills the shared 1.5 GB
and crashes. A dxvk.conf already in TSBin is left as it is.

It also sets the game's own Graphics Rules.sgr (TSData\\Res\\Config in each pack)
for the Switch's 1280x720 screen: in its screen resolution option every default
becomes 1280x720, and a maximum below that is raised to it. Nothing else in the
file changes, and the file as it was is kept as Graphics Rules.sgr.original.

The game is the newest expansion's executable, TSBin\\Sims2EP9.exe. It has no
relocations and is linked for 0x400000, so it needs a 32-bit forwarder, and
even then it only starts when nothing else has taken that address: a run that
says "[IMAGE] this program cannot be moved" wants trying again.

The game's own movies -- the intro, the EA logo, what plays on a television --
are .movie files in Maxis' own format, which the game reads itself: they need no
codec and nothing registered.

VP6 is for the video the game writes rather than the video it reads. It records
gameplay through Video for Windows (AVIStreamWrite and ICSeqCompressFrame are
what Sims2EP9.exe imports), and a custom video made as a VP6 AVI is read the
same way. The codec is the release's to supply and nobody else's to give away:
copy __Installer\\customcomponent\\vp6\\vp6vfw.dll into C:\\windows\\syswow64 on
the card if you want either. The setup registers it under both the names Video
for Windows opens it by, whether or not the file is there.

The language number does two things: the game reads it, and so does the
release's own launcher emulation, which anadius.cfg points at a key of its own
by setting its language to "invalid". The setup writes both. Getting only the
first is how the game comes up saying "open: Invalid handle" and stops.

For a language other than English, put its number in language.txt beside
sims2-setup.exe before running it:

C:\\\\openttd\\\\openttd.exe draws with OpenGL on the Switch GPU (Mesa), plays sound
effects through the win32 driver, and reads openttd.args.txt next to it; putting
-v win32:no_threads there goes back to GDI drawing.
Also staged: C:\\\\pe32-opengl.exe (red, green and blue frames, then PASS and
exit_code=0x0000002a), C:\\\\pe32-audio.exe (audout playback), C:\\\\notepad.exe and
the 7zr benchmark.

Need for Speed Underground 2 and Most Wanted: the DLLs SPEED2.EXE and speed.exe
import are staged (ddraw, dinput8, netapi32, shfolder, tapi32, d3dx9_26 and what
they import), with dbghelp, msvcp140, vcruntime140 and xinput1_4 for XtendedInput:
NFSU2's dinput8.dll and Most Wanted's NFS_XtendedInput.asi. Neither executable
can be moved in memory, so start them through a forwarder set to a 32-bit
address space.

F.E.A.R. (Platinum Collection): d3dx9_27, which FEAR.exe imports and the game's
DirectX installer would otherwise supply.

Fallout New Vegas (GOG): xinput1_3, d3dx9_38 and the windowscodecs that loads its
textures are staged, with msvcp110 and msvcr110 for Galaxy.dll and GalaxyWrp.dll.
Its executable relocates, so it needs no forwarder. Started with no settings of
its own the game hands itself to FalloutNVLauncher.exe and closes, because the
display it is told to use is not one it recognises, so the payload brings the
settings file it would have written:

    C:\\users\\steamuser\\Documents\\My Games\\FalloutNV\\FalloutPrefs.ini

It names the Switch's GPU as DXVK reports it, at 1280x720. The game rewrites
that file once its own options are used; if it already holds settings worth
keeping, keep the [Display] sD3DDevice line and merge the rest.

The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection: everything Sims2EP9.exe imports is already
staged, and gdiplus for the Activation.dll it loads. The release comes installed, so nothing has to be unpacked; what is
missing is the registry the game reads to find each pack, which its own batch
file writes with the paths of the computer it was unpacked on. C:\\The Sims 2
Setup\\sims2-setup.exe writes the same with the card's, and its README says how.

Halo: Combat Evolved: winspool.drv is staged, which is what Halo checks its own
files with. Delete the ._ files a Mac leaves beside every file on the card if
the game was copied from one: Halo loads every DLL in its Controls folder and
one of those is not a DLL. Halo walks with w, a, s and d and works its menus
with the arrows, so the left stick takes one set and the d-pad the other. Put
this beside HALO.EXE as HALO.keys.txt, which is applied over keys.txt:

    LUP=0x57    w, forward: the left stick alone
    LDOWN=0x53  s
    LLEFT=0x41  a
    LRIGHT=0x44 d
    UP=0x26     the arrows, for the menus: the d-pad alone
    DOWN=0x28
    LEFT=0x25
    RIGHT=0x27
    X=0x0d      Enter, to choose a menu item
    Y=0x20      space, to jump
    L=0x45      e, the action key
    R=0x52      r, to reload
    ZL=0x11     left control, to crouch
    ZR=0x09     tab, the scores
    MINUS=0x1b  Escape, to go back

A and B stay the left and right mouse buttons, so A fires and clicks. The right
stick turns the view and the touchscreen drags it like a trackpad. Holding +
and - together leaves the game whatever the keys say. Everything else is in
Halo's own Settings, Controls, which the mouse can now reach.

Left 4 Dead 2: the engine will not start without bin\\valve_avi.dll, which is one
of the app systems its launcher creates, and that imports AVIFIL32, so avifil32
is staged; msvfw32, which avifil32 needs, was already there for WarCraft III's
movies. left4dead2.exe relocates, so it needs no forwarder either. Steam's
GameOverlayRenderer.dll not loading is expected and harmless.

The screen: windows are now shown through OpenGL on the GPU, each in its own
layer drawn in stacking order, instead of copying their pixels straight to the
framebuffer. A program's own OpenGL (OpenTTD, Direct3D games) still takes the
whole screen while it draws; the windows come back when it stops. The log shows
"[INIT] windows shown by the OpenGL compositor" and "[NXCOMP]" lines. If windows
do not show or look wrong, put a file switch/wine/framebuffer.txt containing 1
on the SD card to go back to the framebuffer.

Settings: switch/wine/config/settings.json holds every one of them, and
config/keys.txt the keys the controller sends. Both are set from the launcher --
Settings, Defaults, Controls for the keys everything sends, and a program's own
Controls row for the keys it alone sends -- so neither has to be written by
hand; left and right change a control, A opens the whole list of keys, Y puts
one back to its default. The left stick, the right stick, the d-pad and a
finger dragged across the screen each move the mouse or send four keys, which
the same screen sets: a game played with the mouse wants both sticks on it, one
played with the keyboard wants the keys it walks with. A program uses Autorun's
controls until its own are turned on in its settings, and turning them off again
keeps the keys that were set. A card written by an earlier
build has them loose beside the launcher -- verbose.txt, framebuffer.txt,
no-balance.txt and the rest -- and the first run moves each into settings.json
and takes the file away, saying so in the log. A setting a newer build added is
kept when an older one writes the file back.

autorun_runtime.log holds the run. Its [PROGRESS] lines report OpenGL frames,
the time in eglSwapBuffers and in opengl32 calls, the megabytes Wine copies for
32-bit buffer mappings (copy_mb), whether the GPU maps the program's own pages
(pinned=1, or -1 with pin_rc when nvservices refused them), and the slowest
opengl32 calls of the last ten seconds.
