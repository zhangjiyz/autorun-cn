/*
 * A mouse cursor driven by an analog stick, and the arrow drawn for it.
 *
 * The stick sets a velocity rather than a position. Past a radial dead zone
 * that hides resting drift, the speed grows with the square of the remaining
 * deflection: a slight tilt places the cursor precisely and a full tilt
 * crosses the 1280-pixel screen in about a second. Win32u polls at an
 * irregular rate, so each step is scaled by the time since the previous one,
 * capped so that a stalled message loop cannot fling the cursor away.
 *
 * Horizon has no hardware cursor. The arrow is painted into the back buffer
 * just before a frame is queued and the covered pixels are put back right
 * after, so window blits never pick it up.
