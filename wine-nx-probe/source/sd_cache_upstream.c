 * The SD card read cache (sd_read_cache.h), installed over libnx's sdmc device
 * before the runtime opens a file on it. Everything that reads the card goes
 * through it: Wine's file system calls, image mapping, NLS files and fonts.
 *
 * Files are tracked by libnx's per-open data, so a file opened before the
 * cache was installed passes straight through. Data is copied to the caller
 * after the lock is released: a fault on the caller's buffer must not happen
 * while the cache is locked.
 *
 * Small writes are held back and sent together (sd_write_buffer.h). Reading,
 * opening, renaming or deleting a file sends what is held for it first; stat
 * and fstat add it to the size. The runtime sends everything out every 200 ms
 * and before it leaves.
