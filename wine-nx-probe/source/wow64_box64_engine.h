/* Experimental interpreter entry. Guest pointers are identity mapped; the
 * host exception handler must call wine_nx_box64_handle_fault for unresolved
 * data aborts. Compiler read faults discard the translation and retry through
 * the interpreter. A nonzero completion PC
 * is for embedding/tests, not a guest-accessible native function pointer.
 * Supports integer/segment/SSE transfer with default MXCSR; x87/AVX and
 * nonempty x87 state are rejected explicitly. This is not a full CPU backend.
 * With both dispatch callbacks NULL, returns success at a gate without changing
 * its stack/EAX; the PE caller dispatches and invokes the engine again.
 * Each invocation owns its emulator, allowing native callbacks to reenter. */
