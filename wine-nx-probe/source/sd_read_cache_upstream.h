/*
 * A read cache for files on the SD card, in front of libnx's sdmc device.
 *
 * libnx turns each read() into an fsFileRead request to the FS service. Horizon
 * has no page cache or file mapping, and libnx has no file data cache (Nintendo's
 * SDK keeps one in its fs client library). OpenTTD reads its graphics with a
 * seek and a small read per sprite, so most requests fetch data that a nearby
 * read already had. As Dolphin's SectorReader does for disc images, each file
 * keeps a few chunks: a read inside one is a copy, a miss reads a chunk in one
 * request, and the least recently used chunk is replaced.
 *
 * How much a miss reads follows the file, as an operating system's readahead
 * does: fill_min at first, twice the last fill while the file is read in
 * order, back to fill_min when a read lands elsewhere. Reading 128 KB on
 * every miss cost The Sims 2 eight bytes from the card for every byte it
 * asked for, since it reads scattered records out of large packages, and at
 * the card's 37 MB/s the transfer, not the request, was most of each miss.
 * On the hardware it did not pay: 16 KB fills halved the bytes but nearly
 * tripled the requests, at 0.83 ms each, and the game rereads nearby data more
 * than the replay in tests/sd_read_cache.c does, so the runtime keeps whole
 * chunks (fill_min 0) and this stays for a pool that wants it.
 *
 * A file is cached whatever it was opened for, and a write to a path throws
 * away what every open file with that path holds (sd_cache_written), so the
 * next read of it goes to the card. Refusing to cache anything opened for
 * writing instead left The Sims 2 reading almost all of its packages from the
 * card one kilobyte at a time: it opens them for writing and then only reads.
 * A writer that cannot be recorded, whose writes would go unnoticed, still
 * stops the cache for good. The caller locks around these functions.
